This is a placeholder for the actual images_time.npy file.

The actual file contains all timestamps that are aligned with the data in images.npy.

This file is saved by the method .save_data() of the DataSet() class inside data.py.
It, among others, is read by the method .get_data() of the DataSet() class
and it returns the aligned X, y, and timestamp data for the sky images.

These X, y, and timestamps can then be used as input to
the split_and_preprocess() function inside preprocessing.py
to produce training, validation, and testing data sets.
