This is a placeholder for the actual images.npy file.

The actual file contains all sky images used in this analysis.

It is saved by the method .save_data() of the DataSet() class inside data.py.
This file is read by the method .get_data() of the DataSet() class
and it returns the aligned X, y, and timestamp data for the sky images.

These X, y, and timestamps can then be used as input to
the split_and_preprocess() function inside preprocessing.py
to produce training, validation, and testing data sets.
