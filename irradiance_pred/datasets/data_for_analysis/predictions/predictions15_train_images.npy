This is a placeholder for the actual predictions15_train_images.npy file.

The actual file contains all the 15-min-ahead predictions on the training set of the model trained on images.
The actual folder would contain more files for the other data splits (validation, testing),
for the other data types (images3d, irradiance, weather, combined), and for the other forecast horizons.

For example, the folder would also contain the file: predictions120_test_weather.py
for the 2-hour-ahead predictions on the test set of the weather model.

This file is saved by the create_prediction_data() function inside data.py.
It, among others, is then read by the get_ensemble_data() function inside data.py.

This can then be used to calculate the forecast error of each individual model
and to aggregate their predictions to be used by the ensemble models.
