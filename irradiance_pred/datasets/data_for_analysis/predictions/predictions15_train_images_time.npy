This is a placeholder for the actual predictions15_train_images_time.npy file.

The actual file contains all timestamps that are aligned with the data in predictions15_train_images.npy
The actual folder would contain more timestamp files for the other data splits (validation, testing),
for the other data types (images3d, irradiance, weather, combined), and for the other forecast horizons.

This file is saved by the create_prediction_data() function inside data.py.
It, among others, is then read by the get_ensemble_data() function inside data.py.

This can then be used to calculate the forecast error of each individual model
and to aggregate their predictions to be used by the ensemble models.
