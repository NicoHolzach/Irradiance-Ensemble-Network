This is a placeholder for the actual y_15.npy file.

The actual file contains all true GHI targets for the 15-min ahead forecast horizon.
The actual folder would contain more files for the other forecast horizons.

It is saved by the method .create_targets() of the DataSet() class inside data.py.
This file, among others, is read by the method .get_data() of the DataSet() class
and it returns the aligned X, y, and timestamp data for a specified data type.

These X, y, and timestamps can then be used as input to
the split_and_preprocess() function inside preprocessing.py
to produce training, validation, and testing data sets.
