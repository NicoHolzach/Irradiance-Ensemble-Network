This is a placeholder for the actual weather_1_10_time.npy file.

The actual file contains all timestamps that are aligned with the data in weather_1_10.npy
The actual folder would contain more timestamp files for the other delta-length combinations.

This file is saved by the method .save_data() of the DataSet() class inside data.py.
It, among others, is read by the method .get_data() of the DataSet() class
and it returns the aligned X, y, and timestamp data for the weather sequences.

These X, y, and timestamps can then be used as input to
the split_and_preprocess() function inside preprocessing.py
to produce training, validation, and testing data sets.
