This is a placeholder for the actual irradiance_1_10.npy file.

The actual file contains all irradiance sequences with a delta=1, length=10 used in this analysis.
The actual folder would contain more files for the other delta-length combinations.

It is saved by the method .save_data() of the DataSet() class inside data.py.
This file is read by the method .get_data() of the DataSet() class
and it returns the aligned X, y, and timestamp data for the irradiance sequences.

These X, y, and timestamps can then be used as input to
the split_and_preprocess() function inside preprocessing.py
to produce training, validation, and testing data sets.
